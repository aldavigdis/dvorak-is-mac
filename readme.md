# Icelandic Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Mac OS X

The goal of the project is to create a keyboard layout with the same keys and functionality as the Icelandic QWERTY keyboard, including dead keys. Therefore, it should be possible to re-arrange the buttons without loss of functionality. (Combinations like Alt-E should therefore result in a Euro-symbol, as shown no the key cap.)

Please note that this is a work in progress, is being developed on, and has only been tested on a built-in MacBook Pro 2013 keyboard. This layout might change in the future and if you have any requests or comments, please drop the author a line or file a ticket for the Github repository at https://github.com/stefanvignir/dvorak-is-mac.
