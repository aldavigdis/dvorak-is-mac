# Icelandic Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Mac OS X

This is a project to develop an Icelandic Dvorak keyboard layout. The plan is to keep all the current functionality of the Icelandic QWERTY keyboard inluded with OS X as it is far superior to the standard Icelandic QWERTY keyboard.

Please note that this is a work in progress and has only been tested on a MacBook Pro keyboard. This layout might change in the future and if you have any requests or comments, please drop the autor a line or file a ticket for the Github repository at https://github.com/stefanvignir/dvorak-is-mac.
